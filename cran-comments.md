## Comments
This is the first release of rray.

The install size of rray is on the larger end for an R package, but is 
generally due to xtensor being a header only library.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
