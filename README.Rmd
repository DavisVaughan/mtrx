## Introduction

rray (said: "r-ray") is an array manipulation library for R. It has three main goals:

1) To provide an rray class that tries to be stricter and more consistent than base R arrays, similar in spirit to tibble.

2) To support broadcasting throughout the package, which allows for novel yet intuitive array operations that have been missing from the R ecosystem.

3) To provide a consistent, powerful toolkit for array based manipulation, usable by both the new rray objects and base R matrices/arrays.

View the vignettes for each goal on [the website](https://rray.r-lib.org) to learn more about how to use rray.

```{r}
library(rray)
```

## What can it do?

In short, rray tries to make array manipulation in R more intuitive by combining the idea of broadcasting with knowing when to _not_ drop dimensions. This results in operations such as:

```{r}
x <- rray(1:6, dim = c(3, 2))

# Compute proportions along the 1st dimension
x / rray_sum(x, axes = 1)

# Equivalent base R syntax
sweep(x, 2, apply(x, 2, sum), "/")
```

These concepts are baked into every part of rray, and show up in other functions such as `rray_bind()`. Using broadcasting, `rray_bind()` can bind arrays together in ways that base R cannot with the native `cbind()` and `rbind()` functions.

```{r, error=TRUE}
a <- array(c(1, 2), dim = c(2, 1))
b <- array(c(3, 4), dim = c(1, 2))

a

b

# Error
cbind(a, b)

# `a` is first broadcast to have dimensions: (2, 2)
rray_bind(a, b, axis = 1)

# Error
rbind(a, b)

# `b` is first broadcast to have dimensions: (2, 2)
rray_bind(a, b, axis = 2)
```

## Installation

You can install from Github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/rray")
```

## Acknowledgements

rray would not be possible without the underlying C++ library, [`xtensor`](https://github.com/QuantStack/xtensor). Additionally, rray uses a large amount of the infrastructure in [`vctrs`](https://github.com/r-lib/vctrs) to be as consistent and type stable as possible. 

## Alternatives

The Matrix package implements a small subset of column-wise broadcasting operations. rray fully supports broadcasting in all operations.

The original motivation for this package, and even for xtensor, is the excellent Python library, NumPy. As far as I know, it has the original implementation of broadcasting, and is a core library that a huge number of others are built on top of.

In the past, the workhorse for flexibly binding arrays together has been the abind package. This package has been a great source of inspiration and has served as a nice benchmark for rray.

## Notes

Currently, rray does not handle missing values. This is coming, as the underlying library xtensor natively supports missing values, however a few upstream bugs are currently preventing rray from using those features.

rray will perform best on R 3.6.0 and above. It is able to take advantage of a few of the ALTREP features there, which result in less copies being made per function call.
