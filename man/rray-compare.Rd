\title{Compare arrays}
\usage{
\method{>}{vctrs_rray}(e1, e2)

rray_gt(x, y)

\method{>=}{vctrs_rray}(e1, e2)

rray_gte(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{e1, e2}{Generally, the same as \code{x} and \code{y}. See Details.}

\item{x, y}{Two vectors, matrices, arrays, or rrays.}
}
\description{
These operators compare multiple arrays together, with broadcasting. The
underlying functions powering the comparison operators are also exported
for use with base R objects.
}
\details{
The comparison operators themselves rely on R's dispatching rules to
dispatch to the correct rray comparison operator. When comparing rrays with
base R matrices and arrays, this generally works fine. However, if you
compare classed objects like \code{factor("x") > rray(1)} then a fall through
method is used and a warning is thrown. There is nothing we can do about
this. See \code{?groupGeneric} for more information on this.

\examples{

x <- rray(1:12, c(2, 2, 3))

x > matrix(1:2)
