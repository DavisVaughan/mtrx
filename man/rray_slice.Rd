\title{Get or set a slice of an array}
\usage{
rray_slice(x, i, axis)

rray_slice(x, i, axis) <- value

rray_slice_assign(x, i, axis, value)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix, array or rray.}

\item{i}{Indices to extract along a single axis.
\itemize{
\item Integer-ish indices extract specific elements of dimensions.
\item Logical indices must be length 1, or the length of the dimension you are
subsetting over.
\item Character indices are only allowed if \code{x} has names for the corresponding
dimension.
\item \code{NULL} is treated as \code{0}.
}}

\item{axis}{An integer. The axis to subset.}

\item{value}{A value to be assigned to the slice of \code{x} subset by \code{i}
and \code{axis}. It will be cast to the type and dimension of the slice of \code{x}.}
}
\description{
\code{rray_slice()} is a shortcut wrapper around \code{rray_subset()} that is useful
for easily subsetting a single axis.
}
\details{
\code{rray_slice()} can be used with base R objects as well as rrays.
}
\examples{
x <- rray(1:16, c(2, 2, 2, 2))

# Selecting the first column
rray_slice(x, i = 1, axis = 2)

# rray_slice() is particularly useful for
# subsetting higher dimensions because you don't
# have to worry about the commas
rray_slice(x, i = 2, axis = 4)

# Compare the above with the equivalent
# using `[`
x[, , , 2]

# `i` can be a character vector if `x` has names along `axis`
x <- rray_set_axis_names(x, axis = 4, c("foo", "bar"))
rray_slice(x, "bar", axis = 4)

# The assignment variation can be useful
# for assigning to higher dimensional elements
rray_slice(x, 1, 3) <- matrix(c(99, 100), nrow = 1)
