\title{Find common dimensionalities}
\usage{
rray_dims(x)

rray_dims_common(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object.}

\item{...}{Objects to find common dimensionality for.}
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{rray_dims()} finds the dimensionality of a single object.
\item \code{rray_dims_common()} finds the common dimensionality
among a set of objects.
}
}
\details{
\code{rray_dims_common()} essentially takes the maximum dimensionality of the
inputs. This is the "common" dimensionality. Below is an example of
comparing a \code{(4, 5)} matrix and a \code{(4, 1, 2)} array to get the common
dimensionality.\preformatted{(4, 5,  ) | 2   <- dimensionality of 2
(4, 1, 2) | 3   <- dimensionality of 3
-------------
          | 3   <- maximum of the two is 3
}

A subtle point is that the dimensions do not have to be broadcastable
to still find a common dimensionality. So a \code{(2, 1)} matrix and a \code{(3, 1)}
matrix would not be broadcastable, but have a common dimensionality of \code{2}.

\examples{
x_1_by_4 <- rray(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(1, 4))
x_5_by_1 <- rray(1:5, c(5, 1))

rray_dims(x_1_by_4)

# these are both 2D
rray_dims_common(x_1_by_4, x_5_by_1)

# 1D and 2D have a common dimensionality of 2D
rray_dims_common(x_1_by_4, 1)

# NULL has a dimensionality of 1
rray_dims(NULL)
