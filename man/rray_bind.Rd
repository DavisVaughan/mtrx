\title{Combine many arrays together into one array}
\usage{
rray_bind(..., axis = 1L)

rray_rbind(...)

rray_cbind(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Vectors, matrices, arrays, or rrays.}

\item{axis}{A single integer. The axis to bind along.}
}
\description{
These functions bind multiple vectors, matrices, arrays, or rrays together
into one, combining along the \code{axis}.
}
\examples{
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)
b <- matrix(5:6, ncol = 1)

# Bind along columns
rray_bind(a, b, axis = 2)

# Bind along rows
# Broadcasting is done automatically
rray_bind(a, b, axis = 1)

# You can bind "up" to a new dimension
# to stack matrices into an array
rray_bind(a, b, axis = 3)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dimension name example

x <- matrix(
 1:6,
 ncol = 3,
 dimnames = list(c("a_r1", "a_r2"), c("a_c1", "a_c2", "a_c3"))
)

y <- matrix(
 7:8,
 ncol = 1,
 dimnames = list(NULL, c("b_c1"))
)

# Dimension names come along for the ride
# following rray name handling
rray_bind(x, y, axis = 2)

# But, if any inputs are named
# along the dimension you are binding on
# then all of them must be. This errors
# because `y` doesn't have row names
\dontrun{
rray_bind(x, y)
}

# You can add "outer" names to the
# axis you are binding along
rray_bind(outer = x, y, axis = 2)

# They are added to existing names with `..`
# Outer names can be used to get around the
# fact that `y` isn't named.
rray_bind(outer = x, outer_y = y, axis = 1)
